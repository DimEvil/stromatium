**New interception record** : One *Stromatium longicorne* specimen was discovered in august 2013 in the living quarters of a house in Merelbeke, Ghent, Belgium. The specimen was found, probably just after metamorphosis and was not capable to move at the time of discovery. Hours later the beetle became very active, indicating the beetle was in good condition. The woodworks in the house were thoroughly examined and wooden toys were looked upon intensively but the exit hole was not found. A recent re-examination of one toys, a wooden rocking horse, showed an exit hole which could fit *Stromatium longicorne* (image 1 & 2).

 The house was recently renovated and wood used was *Quercus sp* and *Pseudotsuga sp*. The wooden toys were made in Germany. It's noteworthy that earlier, in the same house a Cerambyx cerdo ref was discovered.
