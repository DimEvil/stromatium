**New interception record** : One *Stromatium longicorne* specimen was discovered in august 2013 in the living quarters of a house in Merelbeke, Ghent, Belgium. The specimen was found, probably just after metamorphosis (image 1) and was not capable to move at the time of discovery.

Hours later the beetle became very active, indicating the beetle was in good condition (image 2).

The woodwork's in the house were thoroughly examined and wooden toys were looked upon intensively but the exit hole was not found. A recent re-examination of one toys, a wooden rocking horse, showed an exit hole which could fit *Stromatium longicorne* (image 3 & 4). The maximal length of the exit hole measures 9 mm and the maximal width measures 6 mm. A second individual was ,to date, never found.

The house was recently renovated and wood used was *Quercus sp* and *Pseudotsuga sp*. The wooden toys were made in Germany and the rocking horse was bought in an antiquities store in Bruges (pers. comm).  It's noteworthy that earlier, in the same house a Cerambyx cerdo ref was discovered.

The specimen was brought to the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences and added to the collection of the saproxylic beetles (image 5).
