*New interception record* : One Stromatium longicorne sp. was discoverd in august 2013 in the living quarters of a house in Merelbeke, Ghent, Belgium. The specimen was probably found just after metamorphosis and was still not capable of moving at the time of discovery. The woodworks in the house were thoroughly examined and wooden toys were looked upon intensively but the exit hole was never found. The house was recently renovated and wood used was *Quercus sp* and *Pseudotsuga sp*. The wooden toys inside were made in Germany.
